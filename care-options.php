                                Residents are supported and encouraged to reside at the most independent level of care
                                consistent with their needs and safety standards. Each resident’s needs are assessed by
                                a Physician or registered nurse within 72 hours of admission. The Direct Care Manager
                                assesses the resident periodically.

                                Independent Plus. Residents at this level are functionally independent or require
                                minimal assistance with mobility, dressing, grooming and bathing and are mentally alert.
                                They may need nutritious meals (including a special diet), assistance with housekeeping
                                and/or laundry and the stimulation or security of not living alone. 5 or less
                                medications are administered by St. Joseph Staff

                                Assisted Care. Resident’s needs at this level are the same as for level I, but require
                                additional staff assistance. Medications may require special monitoring (i.e. blood
                                work). Minimal assistance is required with one or more activities of daily living such
                                as bathing, grooming, toileting, ambulation, transfers, eating, etc.
