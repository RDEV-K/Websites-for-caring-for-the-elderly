                                Employers must make accommodations to disabled applicants and employees where the
                                accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.

                                Under the Michigan law only, disabled employees and applicants may request and
                                accommodation of their disability by notifying the firm in writing of the need for
                                accommodation within 182 days of the date the disabled individual knows of should know
                                that an accommodation is needed. This requirement does not apply to an individual's

                                prelude any claim that the employer failed to accommodate the disabled individual.
